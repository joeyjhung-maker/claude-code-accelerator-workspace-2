# CAST — A Generative Grammar for Video Ad Formats

A faceted system for **decoding any video ad** into its parts and **generating infinite new ones** — while staying human-readable. Lives under the **Creative** node of the creative-strategy system.

> **The big idea (from the $100M Meta thesis):** The new *mechanism* isn't a new claim — it's the **creative format itself**. A never-seen format resets the market's sophistication clock on two levels: the **human brain** (novelty hijacks attention) and the **machine** (Meta can't slot it next to your existing winners, so it finds a fresh audience). The desire is the permanent payload; **the format is the vehicle, and it must change constantly.** The real asset isn't any one format — it's a *system for manufacturing novelty faster than the market copies it.*

## The grammar: CAST = 4 axes

A video ad = a point across four independent axes. Decode any ad → its 4 coordinates (**reverse**). Pick an empty/novel combination → a new format (**generate**).

| Axis | The question | Values (open lists) |
|---|---|---|
| **C — Conceit** | What social shape / skit / premise does it mimic? | talking-head/yapper · podcast · street interview · customer call · cue cards · whiteboard · green-screen react · tutorial/demo · listicle · skit · text-thread · thumb-fight · news/doc … *(open — this is where new types are born; a conceit is a specific TYPE/vehicle, never a generic "story")* |
| **A — Actor** | Who's on screen / whose credibility? | *buckets below* |
| **S — Style** | What substrate / visual look? | live-action · AI-3D (Pixar) · AI-2D cartoon · claymation · motion-graphics · screen-capture · static-in-motion · composite |
| **T — Terrain** | Where is it set? | bedroom/native · office/studio · street/outdoor · in-use (gym/kitchen) · abstract/none |

### Actor buckets (the trust ladder — *whose word are we trusting?*)

| Bucket | = |
|---|---|
| **Unseen** | no figure — product, hands, b-roll, screen |
| **Peer** | a real customer / someone like me |
| **Creator** | hired relatable talent (UGC actor) |
| **Founder** | the maker / brand insider |
| **Authority** | credentialed expert (doctor, coach, scientist) |
| **Celebrity** | borrowed fame |
| **Character** | fictional/animated persona (mascot, Pixar char) |

## Why CAST and not a flat list

The old cut — "Human-first / VO+B-roll / AI animation" — feels off because **each one keys off a different axis**: Human-first = *who* (Actor), VO+B-roll = *how it's delivered*, AI animation = *how it's rendered* (Style). They're not siblings; they're three different axes flattened into one list. CAST promotes each trait to its own axis → MECE-ish, reversible, and generative.

**Two things we deliberately cut** (they failed the *"type-definer or variation-knob?"* test):
- **Delivery** (sync / VO / text-on-screen) → mostly determined by Conceit + Actor; the free part (VO ↔ text) is already an **Iterations** knob. Not a type axis.
- **Fidelity / polish** (ugly → branded) → that's the existing **native ↔ templated ↔ branded** wrapper tied to **awareness**, and it's *emergent* from Actor + Style + Terrain. It crosses all of Creative (statics too), so it stays as that layer — not a CAST axis.

---

## The discipline: stable core, test one knob

Same "turn one knob" rule as the iterations (CASHED) framework. Hold most of CAST stable, move one axis:

- **Novelty (resets the sophistication clock):** new **Conceit** or new **Style** values. This is net-new — what makes an ad feel never-seen.
- **Diversity (varies a known winner):** swap **Actor** or **Terrain**. Same format, fresh face/place — scales a winner without resetting anything.

So: to *manufacture novelty* → push **C** and **S**. To *scale a winner* → vary **A** and **T**.

**The DR skeleton is NOT a CAST axis.** It's the constant payload *underneath* every ad: hook → story → problem → agitate → sell-against → benefits → product → unique mechanism → offer. CAST describes the **vehicle**; the skeleton is the **engine**. Keep them separate or you re-tangle them.

## Reverse test — real ads decoded into CAST

| Ad | Conceit | Actor | Style | Terrain | Novelty came from |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| AI "Pixar" VSL | story/VSL | Character | **AI-3D** | animated | **Style** |
| Thumb Fight | **thumb-fight** | Creator | live-action | native | **Conceit** |
| 3-person POV founder | multi-person POV | Founder | live-action | — | Conceit |
| 2D AI Cartoon founder | explainer | Founder | **AI-2D** | animated | **Style × Actor cross** |
| Cue Card | **cue-cards** | hands/Peer | live-action | neutral | Conceit |
| Customer Call | **phone-call** | Peer + Founder | live/screen-cap | abstract | Conceit |

The grid tells you *where each ad's novelty lives* — and the best ones are often a **cross** nobody had run (Founder × AI-2D).

**Weak seams to watch:** Conceit ↔ Style can bleed on AI (resolution: render = Style, story = Conceit); some Conceits presume a Terrain (street-interview → street). Minor. **Conceit carries the most weight and is the most generative — it's the engine room.**

## The Conceit Engine (the creativity bot)

Conceit is the one axis where novelty actually lives, so it's the only thing you point a creativity bot at. Everything downstream just *applies* the conceit.

```
   what's working  ──┐
   (organic + swipes  │
    + your own ads) ──┤──►  CONCEIT BOT  ──►  new conceits
                       │   (abstracts the *shape*,   (cue-card, customer-call,
   formats you've ────┘    not the copy)              thumb-fight, + net-new)
   already unlocked
```

1. **Feed** — a screen on what's winning *organically* and in *ads* (your STORMING / swipe sources already do this).
2. **Conceit bot** — abstracts the **format/shape** (not the words): "2-voice overheard call," "hands swapping cards" — then remixes / invents new ones.
3. **Output** — each new conceit becomes its **own primer**: winning examples of that format + a light wrapper. Same primer philosophy, teaching the *vehicle* instead of the words.

---

## How this plugs into primers (the two-layer model)

A primer = **raw winning ads + a light meta-instruction wrapper.** Today they're cut by **awareness** and are copy-native. Conceit reveals a second, orthogonal layer:

- **Payload primers** *(exist today)* — cut by **awareness × length**. Teach *what to say and where to enter* = the DR engine. Stable per segment.
- **Conceit primers** *(new)* — cut by **format**. Teach *what shape to pour it into* = the vehicle. ("Story-based" is already one of these hiding in the awareness list — your own note says it "cross-cuts awareness," which is the tell that it's on a different axis.)

**Apply them in sequence — don't multiply them into slots** (awareness × conceit = slot explosion):

```
payload primer (what to say)  →  conceit primer (what shape)  →  Style / Actor / Terrain (production directions)  →  scripted ad
```

This is the "Cache" discipline operationalized: hold the payload stable (segment + awareness + mechanism — the brand truth), **swap the conceit** → a net-new-*feeling* ad with zero new research. One winning payload × 5 conceits = 5 ads that reset the clock. **That's the novelty machine.**

### What a conceit primer encodes
Winning ads of that conceit + a light wrapper for: **(a)** beat → structure mapping, **(b)** register/voice, **(c)** the conceit's native hook type, **(d)** visual-direction cues (where Style/Terrain plug in).

| Conceit | Beat → structure | Voice | Native hook |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cue-card** | one beat per card, ≤8 words | terse, declarative | card 1 = pattern-interrupt line |
| **Customer-call** | beats → two-voice turns | overheard, unpolished | friend's confession/question |
| **Street-interview** | beats → Q&A; respondents stack proof | reactive, real | interviewer's provocation |
| **Thumb-fight** | beats wrap a UI interaction | 4th-wall-breaking | "stop scrolling, put your thumb here" |

## One-line summary

**CAST (Conceit · Actor · Style · Terrain) decodes any video and generates new ones. Conceit is the creative slot — point one bot at it, fed by what's working, outputting new conceits-as-primers. The DR skeleton stays constant underneath; the conceit is the vehicle you swap to manufacture novelty faster than the market copies it.**
